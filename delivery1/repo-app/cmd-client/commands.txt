To create a new org :
python client.py rep_create_org "Org4" "anon3" "anon3" "anon3@example.com" "../public_key.pem"

To create a new session in that org :
python3 client.py rep_create_session "Org4"  "anon3"  "password"  "key"  credentials session_file


To upload a doc with the session(note: this command assumes that the document is not encrypted, so it encrypts it and sends the encrypted key and the file handle within the request) :
python3 client.py rep_add_doc "session_file" "test" "./test"


To list files from a organization of the session key :
python3 client.py c "session_file"
